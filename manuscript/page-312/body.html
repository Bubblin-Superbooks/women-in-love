In one mood, not a bit, in another, very much.”</p><p>“But doesn’t it make you feel ashamed? I think it makes one so ashamed, to be ill—illness is so terribly humiliating, don’t you think?”</p><p>He considered for some minutes.</p><p>“Maybe,” he said. “Though one knows all the time one’s life isn’t really right, at the source. That’s the humiliation. I don’t see that the illness counts so much, after that. One is ill because one doesn’t live properly—can’t. It’s the failure to live that makes one ill, and humiliates one.”</p><p>“But do you fail to live?” she asked, almost jeering.</p><p>“Why yes—I don’t make much of a success of my days. One seems always to be bumping one’s nose against the blank wall ahead.”</p></div> </div>
