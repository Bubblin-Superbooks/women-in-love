She gave her hand with a sudden, unwilling movement, looking all the while at Gerald with a dark, exposed stare. A glow came over him as he sat down.</p><p>The waiter appeared. Gerald glanced at the glasses of the other two. Birkin was drinking something green, Miss Darrington had a small liqueur glass that was empty save for a tiny drop.</p><p>“Won’t you have some more—?”</p><p>“Brandy,” she said, sipping her last drop and putting down the glass. The waiter disappeared.</p><p>“No,” she said to Birkin. “He doesn’t know I’m back. He’ll be terrified when he sees me here.”</p><p>She spoke her r’s like w’s, lisping with a slightly babyish pronunciation which was at once affected and true to her character. Her voice was dull and toneless.</p><p>“Where is he then?” asked Birkin.</p></div> </div>
