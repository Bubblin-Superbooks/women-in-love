Love is one of the emotions like all the others—and so it is all right whilst you feel it. But I can’t see how it becomes an absolute. It is just part of human relationships, no more. And it is only part of <em>any</em> human relationship. And why one should be required <em>always</em> to feel it, any more than one always feels sorrow or distant joy, I cannot conceive. Love isn’t a desideratum—it is an emotion you feel or you don’t feel, according to circumstance.”</p><p>“Then why do you care about people at all?” she asked, “if you don’t believe in love? Why do you bother about humanity?”</p><p>“Why do I?
