Nor can I say “I love you,” when I have ceased to be, and you have ceased to be: we are both caught up and transcended into a new oneness where everything is silent, because there is nothing to answer, all is perfect and at one. Speech travels between the separate parts. But in the perfect One there is perfect silence of bliss.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">They were married by law on the next day, and she did as he bade her, she wrote to her father and mother.</p></div> </div>
