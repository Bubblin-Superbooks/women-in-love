Oh, it’s impossible, the way she tries to bully one. Pure bullying. She’s an impudent woman. ‘You’ll come and see me,’ as if we should be falling over ourselves for the privilege.”</p><p>“I can’t understand, Ursula, what you are so much put out about,” said Gudrun, in some exasperation. “One knows those women are impudent—these free women who have emancipated themselves from the aristocracy.”</p><p>“But it is so _unnecessary_—so vulgar,” cried Ursula.</p><p>“No, I don’t see it. And if I did—pour moi, elle n’existe pas. I don’t grant her the power to be impudent to me.”</p><p>“Do you think she likes you?” asked Ursula.</p><p>“Well, no, I shouldn’t think she did.”</p></div> </div>
