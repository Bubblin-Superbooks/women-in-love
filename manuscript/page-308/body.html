So she passed through the empty farm-yard and through the wilderness of a garden, and mounted the bank by the sluice. When she got to the top, to see the old, velvety surface of the pond before her, she noticed a man on the bank, tinkering with a punt. It was Birkin sawing and hammering away.</p><p>She stood at the head of the sluice, looking at him. He was unaware of anybody’s presence. He looked very busy, like a wild animal, active and intent. She felt she ought to go away, he would not want her. He seemed to be so much occupied. But she did not want to go away. Therefore she moved along the bank till he would look up.</p><p>Which he soon did. The moment he saw her, he dropped his tools and came forward, saying:</p><p>“How do you do? I’m making the punt water-tight. Tell me if you think it is right.”</p><p>She went along with him.</p></div> </div>
