Best strive with oneself only, not with the universe.</p><p>“God cannot do without man.” It was a saying of some great French religious teacher. But surely this is false. God can do without man. God could do without the ichthyosauri and the mastodon. These monsters failed creatively to develop, so God, the creative mystery, dispensed with them. In the same way the mystery could dispense with man, should he too fail creatively to change and develop. The eternal creative mystery could dispose of man, and replace him with a finer created being. Just as the horse has taken the place of the mastodon.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It was very consoling to Birkin, to think this. If humanity ran into a <em>cul de sac</em> and expended itself, the timeless creative mystery would bring forth some other being, finer, more wonderful, some new, more lovely</p></div> </div>
