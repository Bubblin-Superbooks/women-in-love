Dissolution rolls on, just as production does,” he said. “It is a progressive process—and it ends in universal nothing—the end of the world, if you like. But why isn’t the end of the world as good as the beginning?”</p><p>“I suppose it isn’t,” said Ursula, rather angry.</p><p>“Oh yes, ultimately,” he said. “It means a new cycle of creation after—but not for us. If it is the end, then we are of the end—<em>fleurs du mal</em> if you like. If we are <em>fleurs du mal</em>, we are not roses of happiness, and there you are.”</p><p>“But I think I am,” said Ursula. “I think I am a rose of happiness.”</p><p>“Ready-made?” he asked ironically.</p></div> </div>
