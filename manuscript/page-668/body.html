He wondered at her, knowing she was aware of his presence. She had her queer, radiant, breathless manner, as if confused by the actual world, unreal to it, having a complete bright world of her self alone.</p><p>“Have I interrupted a conversation?” she asked.</p><p>“No, only a complete silence,” said Birkin.</p><p>“Oh,” said Ursula, vaguely, absent. Their presence was not vital to her, she was withheld, she did not take them in. It was a subtle insult that never failed to exasperate her father.</p><p>“Mr Birkin came to speak to <em>you</em>, not to me,” said her father.</p></div> </div>
