It was fate.</p><p>“You are so muddy,” she said, in distaste, but gently.</p><p>He looked down at his feet.</p><p>“I was walking in the dark,” he replied. But he felt vividly elated. There was a pause. He stood on one side of the tumbled bed, she on the other. He did not even take his cap from his brows.</p><p>“And what do you want of me,” she challenged.</p><p>He looked aside, and did not answer. Save for the extreme beauty and mystic attractiveness of this distinct, strange face, she would have sent him away. But his face was too wonderful and undiscovered to her. It fascinated her with the fascination of pure beauty, cast a spell on her, like nostalgia, an ache.</p></div> </div>
