The elder was a short, hard-faced energetic man of middle age, the younger a labourer of twenty-three or so. They stood in silence watching the advance of the sisters. They watched whilst the girls drew near, and whilst they passed, and whilst they receded down the dusty road, that had dwellings on one side, and dusty young corn on the other.</p><p>Then the elder man, with the whiskers round his face, said in a prurient manner to the young man:</p><p>“What price that, eh? She’ll do, won’t she?”</p><p>“Which?” asked the young man, eagerly, with a laugh.</p><p>“Her with the red stockings. What d’you say?
