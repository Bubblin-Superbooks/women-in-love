The days of Homer were his ideal, when a man was chief of an army of heroes, or spent his years in wonderful Odyssey.

He turned his face entirely away from the blackened mining region that stretched away on the right hand of Shortlands, he turned entirely to the country and the woods beyond Willey Water. It was true that the panting and rattling of the coal mines could always be heard at Shortlands. But from his earliest childhood, Gerald had paid no heed to this.

He rebelled against all authority. Life was a condition of savage freedom.</p></div> </div>
