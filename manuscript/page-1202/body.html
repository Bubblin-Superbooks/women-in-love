<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">German opera, the German theatre. It <em>will</em> be amusing to take part in German Bohemian life. And Loerke is an artist, he is a free individual. One will escape from so much, that is the chief thing, escape so much hideous boring repetition of vulgar actions, vulgar phrases, vulgar postures. I don’t delude myself that I shall find an elixir of life in Dresden. I know I shan’t. But I shall get away from people who have their own homes and their own children and their own acquaintances and their own this and their own that. I shall be among people who <em>don’t</em> own things and who <em>haven’t</em> got a home and a domestic servant in the background, who haven’t got a standing and a status and a degree and a circle of friends of the same. Oh God, the wheels within wheels of people, it makes one’s head tick like a clock, with a very madness of dead mechanical monotony and meaninglessness. How I <em>hate</em> life, how I hate it. How I hate the Geralds, that they can offer one nothing else.</p></div> </div>
