Her softness, her inert, relaxed weight lay against his own surcharged, bronze-like limbs in a heaviness of desirability that would destroy him, if he were not fulfilled. She moved convulsively, recoiling away from him. His heart went up like a flame of ice, he closed over her like steel. He would destroy her rather than be denied.</p><p>But the overweening power of his body was too much for her. She relaxed again, and lay loose and soft, panting in a little delirium. And to him, she was so sweet, she was such bliss of release, that he would have suffered a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second of this pang of unsurpassable bliss.</p><p>“My God,” he said to her, his face drawn and strange, transfigured, “what next?”</p><p>She lay perfectly still, with a still, child-like face and dark eyes, looking at him. She was lost, fallen right away.</p></div> </div>
